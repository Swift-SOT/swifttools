    "# The `swifttools.ukssdc.data` module\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latest version v1.0, released in swifttools v3.0**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The `data` module provides direct access to data and services if you know the details of the object you are interested in (if you don't, you probably want the [query module](query.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic `swifttools.ukssdc.data` module provides just two functions, described on this page, for accessing Swift's observational data; but there are also two submodules which significantly extend this functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`swifttools.ukssdc.data.GRB`](data/GRB.ipynb) - this gives access to GRB data products and related tools (light curve rebinning, timeslicing spectra).\n",
    "* [`swifttools.ukssdc.data.SXPS`](data/SXPS.ipynb) - this gives access to the data in the SXPS catalogues.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are only two things we can do with the top-level `data` module. We can download observation data by specifying an obsid (or a list of them), or by specifying a targetID, and I will demonstrate these below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just to clarify from the off, by 'observation data', I mean the set of data you get on the archive or quick-look site for an observation, like you can see [here](https://www.swift.ac.uk/archive/browsedata.php?oid=00030366099&source=obs).\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing worth noting before we start: various other classes and functions will call this module behind the scenes. So, for example, when we come to [`ukssdc.data.GRB` module](data/GRB.ipynb) the `getObsData()` function will basically wrap the `downloadObsData()` function demonstrated here, passing on various arguments via `**kwargs`, so even if you don't intend using this module directly, it's helpful to know a bit about it.\n",

The function for this is cunningly named `downloadObsData()` and has just one mandatory parameter, the obsid, which should be the first parameter. There are quite a few optional ones which we'll consider in a minute, but to start with I'll just include a couple."

It is always assigned a default value, relative to the current directory so you don't *need* it, but ask yourself this: who knows better where to save your data, you or me? (I'm flattered, but not, it's not me). \n",
    "* `silent` is `True` by default and basically supresses all output except important warnings or errors. When running interactively, like in this tutorial, I like to set `silent=False` because I get some feedback on what's happening, but in standalone scripts, you probably want to leave this as `True`. \n",
    "* `verbose` does not appear above, but is also present in almost every function. This parameter (which defaults to `False`), causes extra output to appear on your console. The idea was the `silent` would turn of all messages, whereas `verbose` would add a load of extra ones. I freely confess that the judgement about what is classed as `verbose` is somewhat arbitrary.\n",

The reason is that 'auxil', and indeed 'tdrss' and 'log', are not actually instruments so aren't included in the `instruments` parameter. Instead they are controlled by three parameters: `getAuxil`, `getTDRSS` and `getLog`. By default `getAuxil` is `True` (because you usually need this for any analysis) while the others are `False` (because you don't). \n",
