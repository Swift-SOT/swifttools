    "Having carried out a query, such as above, you may want to access some of the data related to the objects found. You could take the object identifiers from your queries, and then pass them to the [`swifttools.ukssdc.data.SXPS` functions](../data/SXPS.ipynb) to get at your data, but this is a bit of a drag, so the `SXPSQuery` module provides wrappers to do all of that for you, as we will now demonstrate. Note: I am *not* going to detail all of the arguments for the various data access functions, nor what they return: read the [data documentation](../data/SXPS.ipynb) for that. I will, however, give a few quick notes here (as I did for GRBs):\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let me remind you that by default all of the functions to get data (starting `get`), when called via the `query` module, neither save data to disk nor return it, but save it in a variable inside your `SXPSQuery` object. You can change this behaviour with the `saveData` and `returnData` arguments, but even then, the data will still be stored in class variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second: the data you request must be indexed in some way (to show which object they belong to). In the [`data.SXPS` module](../data/SXPS.ipynb) you controlled how the results were indexed by how you identified the objects you wanted, i.e. whether you supplied the `sourceName` or `sourceID` parameter to a `get()` function. When getting data from an `SXPSQuery` object, you use the `byName` or `byID` parameter to state how you want the results indexed (or, for datasets, `byObsID` and `byDatasetID`). We will see some examples below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third: You can request products for only a subset of the results your query found, using the [`subsets` argument](../query.ipynb#subsets).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the basic syntax of every product retrieval function is the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "`q.get<something>(byID, byName, subset, returnData, saveData, **kwargs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `**kwargs` are any arguments you want to pass to the underlying function in [`SXPS.GRB`](../data/SXPS.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, without wasting more time on abstract explanations, let's get to the examples. Data products are only available for the 'sources', 'datasets' and 'transients' tables, and we'll go through these in turn and (hopefully) at speed."

I cannot see why you would want to do this for the query module, and you could always just submit an empty query I guess (although this would be slow), so being nice, I provided a quick wrapper. You literally just do: `q.getFullTable()`; the catlaogue, table and subset are properties of your `SXPSQuery` object, so you don't set them. You can provide an `epoch`, for LSXPS tables, although if you want to know what epochs are available you'll need to use the `data` module.\n",
