However, as there has been (much!) demand for a way to access XRT products for samples derived from other information, I've provided tools to use two other catalogues provided by [the SDC](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov) as well. So, the `GRBQuery` module lets use select the following catalogues:\n",

    "* [The live XRT GRB catalogue](https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_live_cat) \"UK_XRT\"\n",

This means that there is always the possibility that things are slightly out of sync, but never by more than an hour. I also created the metadata myself, so any errors therein are entirely my own fault.\n",

    "The Swift Data Table is curated by JD Myers at GSFC, and is essentially manually compiled from information contained in GCN circulars. This has presented the occasional challenge ingesting everything into a form that can be queried by this API. For example, how will a T90 value of \"~2\" fare with a \">\" operator? To resolve this, I strip out the non-numeric characters from columns like this, and set some warning columns [which we will look at presently](#dtcaveat).\n",

Secondly, when I ingested that table I found a couple of GRBs with duplicate rows; only the first row is ingested ('name' is required as a unique column for combining catalogues).\n",

Any time a field cannot be ingested 'as is' (for example a numerical field that contained a non-numerical character), then the '\\_warn' column for that row is set to `True` and the '\\_orig' field is populated - this is a text field containing the original string. So, for example, if there was a problem with \"BAT_T90\" then the \"BAT_T90\" column will be replaced with my code's \"best guess\" as to the correct numerical value, \"BAT_T90_orig\" will be set to the original value, and \"BAT_T90_warn\" will be 1.\n",

And for this purpose the `GRBQuery` class includes the concept of auxilliary catalogues. The premise here is very simple: you define a `GRBQuery` and select the catalogue to query on, I will call this the 'primary catalogue'. Then you can add a second catalogue, which we call the 'auxilliary catalogue'. Then you define filters and submit, and the only results returned will be those which met the criteria in both catalogues.\n",

    "## GRB Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Having identified a sample of GRBs, we may want to actually get at some of the data - recall my example above where I've been asked for the ability to *download all XRT light curves* for GRB with T90&lt;2 s. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is easy to do, because the `GRBQuery` class provides wrappers to all of the [`swifttools.ukssdc.data.GRB` functions](../data/GRB.ipynb). As [already explained for `ObsQuery`](../query.ipynb#prods), the syntactic difference is just that we don't provide the list of objects to retrieve, that is automatically taken from `q.results`, but we can provide [a subset](../query.ipynb#subsets) of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also remind you that I am *not* going to spend ages detailing all the different options available for downloading products and what they do. I did it in the [`data.GRB` documentation](../data/GRB.ipynb) so you can refer to that for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing to remind you is that by default all of the functions to get data (starting `get`), when called via the `query` module, neither save data to disk nor return it, but save it in a variable inside your `GRBQuery` object. You can change this behaviour with the `saveData` and `returnData` arguments, but even then, the data will still be stored in class variables. I will introduce those variables to you in a moment, but first let me tell you something about them. They are always  `dict`s with one key per object in your query results, even if there was only one object found. You can decide whether the key is the GRB name or targetID by specifying **one** of `byName=True` or `byID=True` (if you specify neither, name is assumed). Of course, your results must include the specified column.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the basic syntax of every product retrieval function is the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "`q.get<something>(byID, byName, subset, returnData, saveData, **kwargs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `**kwargs` are any arguments you want to pass to the underlying function in [`data.GRB`](../data/GRB.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's run some demos. We'll stick with the query above, but I'll repeat the cells here in case you haven't run them or have been doing your own editing:"

    "If you're wondering where the options to rebin light curves or time-slice spectra are then I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed. Making it easy for you to (deliberately or accidentally) request time-sliced spectra for 1,500 GRBs is not something I want to do -- we do, after all, have a finite compute load. However, it should be pretty easy for you to write a code to loop over your results and submit such jobs, one or two at a time. I would do it now as a demo, but I'm not *that* nice :)"
