    "# The `swifttools.ukssdc.query` module\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latest version v1.0, released in swifttools v3.0**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `query` module provides tools to query various catalogues held at the UKSSDC (and a couple of others) and provides wrappers to get data for the objects we find. There are two types of query supported, a cone search and a more complex search applying filters to different fields. These are analogous to the 'simple' and 'advanced' searches available on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the [the `data` module](data.ipynb) (which provided functions to get specific products), the `query` module provided classes: we create query objects and then manipulate and use these to perform our query and play with the results. There are three query classes provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ObsQuery - This lets us query the databases of Swift observations.\n",
    "* [GRBQuery](query/GRB.ipynb) - This lets us query several GRB catalogues.\n",
    "* [SXPSQuery](query/SXPS.ipynb) - This lets us query the SXPS catalogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever class you want, I **strongly** advise you to read this page first. Although it deals with the `ObsQuery` class, that class only contains functionality common to all of the classes, and so all the common concepts are introduced here, and not necessarily repeated on the other pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `query` module also provides access to data or data products, by wrapping functions from [the data module](data.ipynb).I will not go into much detail about those functions and what they produce, since this has been covered in the relevant pages for the [data module](data.ipynb) already. One crucial point, however, does need discussing: how the query module makes any requested data available to you (if you haven't read about the data module, ignore this point because it will just confuse you - you'll see how we get data shortly).\n",
    "\n",
    "In [the data module](data.ipynb) the default behaviour when getting a product was to download files to disk, but you could instead request the data be returned from the function so you could capture it in a variable. For the query module, the requested data are always stored in variables inside your query object. You can still also request that they be saved to disk, or returned from the function that got them (using the same `returnData` and `saveData` arguments as in [the data module](data.ipynb)) but these are not done by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate the query interface for observation data, which is quite straightforward and also gets us familiar with the module syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will import the query module as `uq`:"
