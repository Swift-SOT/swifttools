'''The `swift_too` module provides a Python API that gives you almost
everything you need to plan and submit Target of Opportunity (TOOs) 
requests to the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (hereafter *Swift*).

The module is split into the following main classes:

1. Swift_TOO

This allows Target of Opportunity requests to be constructed and
submitted. This includes basic validation before submission, and querying
of the status of the request. This is used in the case where you either
don't want to have to deal with manual web forms, or you wish to submit a
TOO request to Swift based on an automated trigger, for example, if your
telescope detects a new transient, and you want Swift to observe it ASAP,
you can automate the process of TOO submission using this class. A debug
mode is provided to allow you to test the process of submitting a TOO
request to completion, without actually submitting a TOO.

2. Swift_ObsQuery

This class allows you to query what observations Swift has already
performed. It allows you to search for observations by target ID (a unique
identifier for a target) or Observation ID (a unique identifier for a
single observation). Also it allows for searches around fixed celestial
coordinates, the default inputs for this are J2000 right ascension (RA),
declination (dec) and radius in decimal degrees, however we also support
astropy's `SkyCoord` to allow for other coordinate systems to be used for
searches, e.g. Galactic Coordinates. In addition you can narrow the search
to specific date ranges.

3. Swift_VisQuery

J2000 RA/dec (given as a `SkyCoord` or `ra` and `dec` properties in
decimal degrees). Before submitting a TOO request it's important that you
understand if a target can actually be observed by Swift. Targets are
typically not observable by Swift if they are closer than 45 degrees to
the Sun, 21 degrees and to the Moon. However, targets that are close to
+/-69 in declination can exhibit periodic pole constraints also that can
cause visibility issues for ~10 day periods. High resolution visibility
can be requested, which gives object visiblity at 1 minute timescales, and
includes Earth occultation and periods inside the South Atlantic Anomaly.
As these are computationally expensive to calculate, we limit high
resolution visibliity requests to 20 days in length.

4. Swift_PlanQuery

Similar to Swift_ObsQuery but in this case queries the Swift observing
plan, otherwise known as the pre-planned science timeline (PPST). This
allows the user to query what was planned to be observed by Swift, and
what will be observed in the future. Please note that due to Swift's quick
planning turn around, the amount of information on future plans will be
limited to the next 1-3 days typically.

5. QueryJob

In addition results of jobs can be fetched using the QueryJob module. This
can be used to fetch results of already processed jobs, or query the
current status of a job. Typically a job will have 4 status values,
`Queued`, `Processing`, `Accepted` or `Rejected`. `Accepted` in this case
means that processing has completed. `Queued` means that the job has been
accepted, but not yet processed. `Processing` means that the server is
working on the results, but has not yet completed. `Rejected` means that
the server rejected the job for any number of reasons, that are reported
by in `Swift_TOO_Status` class.

6. UVOT_mode

UVOT modes are typically given as hex modes. This class allows the user to
look up the meaning of a given hex code, which is typically a table of
UVOT filters associated with that mode, along with any configuration
parameters, such as the size of the field of view, whether the data will
be taken in event mode, etc.

7. Swift_TOO_Requests

This class allows querying of TOO Requests submitted to Swift. By default
this will give detail on the most recent 10 TOO requests submitted to
Swift. Alternatively, TOOs info can be fetched by year, ID, RA/Dec/Radius,
or within a set time period. In addition if the `detail` parameter is set
to `True`, then this retrieves all information about a TOO request,
including non-public information, for TOO requests that you submitted, if
you supply your `username` and `shared_secret`. The class essentially is a
container for a number of `Swift_TOO_Request` objects. In the case where
targets are scheduled in the Swift planning calendar, a `Swift_Calendar`
object will be attached which lists the scheduled windows, and shows how
much exposure was obtained during those windows.

8. Swift_Calendar

`Swift_Calendar` class allows for querying calendar entries for a given
TOO. The Calendar shows all planned observations for a TOO, along with an
estimate of how much time was actually observed during the calendar
window. Note that this is different from the Swift Plan, insofar as the
Swift Calendar lists requested observations and can go much farther into
the future. However, due to Swift's oversubscription, and other issues,
even if an object is in the Calendar, that is not guarantee that Swift
will observe it on that day, only that it is in the queue to be observed.

9. Swift_GUANO

`Swift_GUANO` provides API access to data obtained by the *Gamma-Ray
Urgent Archiver for Novel Opportunities* (GUANO). GUANO proactively dumps
BAT event data, which would otherwise be lost, based on external triggers.
These triggers include Fast Radio Bursts, Gamma-Ray Bursts from other
missions, Gravitational Wave triggers and Neutrino triggers. `Swift_GUANO`
allows to query these dumps and gives you metadata about the dump.

10. Swift_Data

`Swift_Data` provides an easy interface to download archival or quick-look
data from the Swift Science Data Centers in the USA or UK. 

11. Swift_Resolve

`Swift_Resolve` provides an simple interface to resolve target names into
coordinates, leveraging several name resolvers. This class is also called
by other classes when you pass the `name` parameter instead of giving an
`ra`, `dec` or `skycoord`.

The Swift TOO API is built around a client/server model, in which API
information is exchanged between the client's machine with the Swift API
server in JSON format. Requests are submitted using a signed JWT (e.g.
https://jwt.io) format, and API users are required to register with Swift
to use the API (https://www.swift.psu.edu/toop) to submit TOO requests.
JWT are not encrypted, but they are signed with a "shared secret" to
ensure that the requests are coming from the user they say they are. Note
that for all requests that are not submitting a TOO, the username can be
set to `anonymous`. In fact this is the default if no username is given.

Queries are constructed using Python classes provided by this module, and
submitted to a queue system in which they are processed in a first come,
first served basis. Typically processing requests takes a 10-20 seconds.
Status of requests can be queried, and errors are reported back.
