    "The Swift_TOO class is used to submit Target of Opportunity Requests for the Swift mission. Before this required manual filling out of a web based form, but given the requirements to trigger Swift using algorithmically determined criteria, this can now be automated through the Swift TOO API, and this class. Here we give a simple example of how to submit a TOO request with this class. Note that we will enable debug mode here, so that the submission will actually complete, but importantly it will not submit an *actual* Swift TOO!"
